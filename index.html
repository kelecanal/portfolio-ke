                <h2>introductions</h2>
                <p>Hi there! My name is Kareine Elecanal. Most people can't pronounce my first name, so everyone usually calls me Kara. I'm currently located in San Diego, California, but I'm moving to Seattle, Washington later this year! I'm a pastry chef turned aspiring web developer. I can relate a lot of what I have learned in all my years working in kitchens to web development. Coding and recipes share many similarities, and I look forward to uncovering what those similarities are.</p>

                <h3>about me</h3>
                <p>When I was really young, and even to this day, I really liked puzzles, any type of puzzle! I loved the feeling of using my brain to solve something that didn't have an immediate answer. And as I grew up and grew older, I realized my love for the internet. And, to some small extent, very very basic coding skills. As I was growing up, MySpace was something that was really popular amongst my peers. I would tinker with the HTML codes of layouts that I liked, and tweaked them to my liking. Eventually, MySpace became almost obsolete and my focus shifted to other things. Two things, to be more specific; high school and video games.</p>
                <p>I ended up eventually going into kitchens, working pastry. A different kind of puzzle. It was something that I did extremely well, and being in kitchens taught me many things about myself. The most important of them all, that I could more than hang with the boys. The idea of being one of the few girls in an industry that was mostly made up of men was no longer dismaying or daunting to me.</p>
